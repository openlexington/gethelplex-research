### GOAL: meet with group of supporters and seekers of treatment


20 or so participants in group discussion led by Amy Baker of LFUCG Social Services

**

### KEY QUOTES + COMMENTS

#### Why are we here?

* Many barriers exist to securing treatment
	* Centers say that only the addicted can call for themselves.
	* Wait times are almost always at least several weeks if not months and the waiting is detrimental to the seeker.
	* People don't know about Casey's Law where a supporter can petition a judge to send someone to treatment. Our application should let people know about Casey's law.
* It's never clear if your insurance covers the treatment
	* "You don't know who to call. You get bounced around different services because no one knows."
	* "I had health insurance but it didn't cover most treatment options. I finally found one option that took my insurance through word of mouth."
* "Help people get tested for disease to stop outbreaks like the HIV outbreak in Indiana."
* "We supporters need to be supported"
	* "There are no resources for siblings trying to help."
* Police have a card that they pass out to addicts that says "event in the darkest light there's hope." This could contain a url to the directory.
* When you're a parent, you need treatment that's close to your children but it's hard to search that way.
* The Fayette jail organizes continuity of care for people being released so they are potential users of the system.

#### What's the most important information when seeking treatment?

* "Is it faith-based versus 12-step which is mostly secular approach"
* "Outpatient location is super important because you have to return home each day."
* "Is psychoanalysis based?"
* "Every program says it has a 95% success rate, which everyone knows to ignore."
	* Set expectations about how long it takes to recover. For many, it is years.
* "Length of the treatment"
* "Cost calculator so people know what they need up-front."
* "Personal recommendations, they count the most." Potential to connect people?
* "Need a 24/7 hotline."
	* How does the 212 hotline compare?
	* "AA has an InterGroup system that is volunteer run. A problem is that wet drunks call who are not serious about recovery."
	* "Which centers are open right now?"
* A description of how the treatment works
	* Tough love or soft touch?
	* Let people know what to expect
	* "What's the methodology?"
	* "Some centers make you wear gray sweatpants and no makeup. People want to know that."
	* "Whether you can smoke or not is a huge deal for people."

* The problem is not many people understand insider language. The application must help clairfy.
	* Is medical versus non-medical detox.
	* Is supervised versus unsupervised residential.
	* People don't know about the drug assisted therapies.

#### What do google when looking for treatment?

* "Alcohol rehab"
* "Heroin addiction"
* "Treatment centers"
* "Pain pills"

#### Should we include other services?

* "People need help finding jobs and housing or they won't stay clean."
* "Break that into a different search so that it's not too overwhelming."
* [Jubilee Jobs](http://jubileejobsoflexington.org/) specializes in finding jobs for the hard-to-place, e.g. people with records. Funded through the city.


#### What is wanted in the application?

* "A grid with checkboxes that narrows the results. I'm thinking cars.com."

### Recommendations

* Give lots of in-context help about the many insider terms. They are a big barrier to making a decision about treatment. Use tooltips, perhaps link to a glossary.
* To help supporters, make sure search is captured in the url so it's easy to share. Perhaps provide an 'email this search' capability.
