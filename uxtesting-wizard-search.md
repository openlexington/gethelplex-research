## April, 2015: Treatment Locator usability testing

### GOAL: Observe how people respond to a wizard style search where they answer a series of questions and see results

2 participants

***

#### Particiants (randomized names)

* Chris, 28, law enforcement and supporter
* James, 60, engineer and supporter

### Methodology

* Ask participants to visit a url on their personal device.
* https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/gethelpky


### Key observations

* James used large text and held the phone in landscape mode.
* Was not clear if you could choose multiple options or just one.

### Comments

* "You might talk to your son and he says it's recreational use. So you're left with the question: does he really need treatment in the first place?" - James

### Recommendations

* Chris and James answered the questions quickly and understood everything, though they are also somewhat expert since they take part in a weekly supporters meeting. It's important to test with people who are less familiar with treatment.
* The results page is an image mockup without much information. We should increase the fidelity on the results to real html and see how they interact.
* Looking at cars.com mobile, they show the 3 most important wizard-like questions up-front and then offer more search facets on the results page. This could be a good compromise so that people see results more quickly and simplify the UI as well.
